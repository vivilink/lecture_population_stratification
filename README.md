Description
=========================

I created this set of exercises + lecture to demonstrate the importance of correcting for population structure in GWAS using 1000 Genomes data.

Data
----------

- 1000 Genomes Data that is LD pruned for three different populations (CDX, TSI, JPT)
- Phenotypes affected by stratification

Exercises
------------
1.  run association tests with Plink without correcting for structure
2.  run association tests with Plink by correcting for structure with PCs
3.  run association tests with GCTA by correcting for structure with GRM
